This reflects the financial consequences of policy frameworks, which are based on pro-poor development strategies, which allows to measure progress on the SDG target 1.b.</p>\n<p>Relationship with other SDGs: The indicator could be compared with the one under SDG 10 on equity of fiscal policy. Countries should be encouraged to collect and analyse the data within a single process to create synergy and avoid unnecessary duplication.</p>\n<p>Limitations: The indicator does not take into effect the consequences of revenue-related fiscal activities, such as taxes or contributions to public insurance systems, on the poor.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p><u>Population in the poorest 20% of households</u> can be derived directly from a nationally representative micro-data set (an Income and Expenditure Survey, for example).</p>\n<p><u>Public spending on social services</u> can be directly derived from budget administrative data.</p>\n<p>A fiscal incidence analysis is required to estimate the benefit the poor individuals or households (depending on underlying survey data) are receiving from those services. The incidence analysis measures the monetised value of in-kind transfers in education and health services at average government costs. In addition, this indicator includes cash and near cash transfers in the definition of social services (conditional and unconditional cash transfers, school feeding programmes etc.). The procedures are described in detailed in the CEQ Handbook, Meerman, Jacob (1979), Selowsky, Marcelo (1979), and many other ones.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Every year, UNICEF validates the latest data on all the SDG indicators UNICEF is custodian for.
