The welfare of people living in different countries can be measured on a common scale by adjusting for differences in the purchasing power of currencies. The commonly used $1 a day standard, measured in 1985 international prices and adjusted to local currency using purchaing power parity (PPP) exchange rates, was chosen for World Development Report 1990 because it was typical of the poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. The last change was in June 2025, when the World Bank adopted $3.00 as the international poverty line using the 2021 PPP. Prior to that, the 2022 update set the international poverty line at $2.15 using the 2017 PPP (and can be accessed at <a href=\"https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpip.worldbank.org%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cshibata%40un.org%7Cdcfa537abc4840e8db5508ddd6fc1b00%7C0f9e35db544f4f60bdcc5ea416e6dc70%7C0%7C0%7C638903100476885459%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=u5JzRxQG0fN3PIw7QIcg25FN0I7e9ymNKwR4ZD978m4%3D&amp;reserved=0\">https://pip.worldbank.org/</a> by selecting the corresponding PPP) and the 2015 update set the international poverty line at $1.90 using the 2011 PPP.

The World Bank produced its first global poverty estimates for developing countries for World Development Report 1990: Poverty (World Bank 1990) using household survey data for 22 countries (Ravallion, Datt, and van de Walle 1991). Since then there has been considerable expansion in the number of countries that field household income and expenditure surveys. The World Bank&apos;s Development Data Group and Poverty and Equity Global Practice maintain a database, PIP, that is updated annually as new survey data become available (and thus may contain more recent data or revisions) and conducts a major reassessment of progress against poverty every year. PIP is an interactive computational tool that allows users to replicate these internationally comparable $3.00 a day global, regional and country-level poverty estimates and to compute poverty measures for country groupings and for different poverty lines. </p>\n<p>PIP also provides access to the database and user-friendly dashboards with graphs and interactive maps that visualize trends in key poverty and inequality indicators for different regions and countries. The country dashboards display trends in poverty measures based on the national poverty lines alongside the internationally comparable estimates.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Despite progress in the last decade, the challenges of measuring poverty remain. The timeliness, frequency, quality, and comparability of household surveys needs to increase substantially, particularly in the poorest countries. The availability and quality of poverty monitoring data remains low in small states, countries with fragile situations, and low-income countries and even some middle-income countries. The low frequency and lack of comparability of the data available in some countries create uncertainty over the magnitude of poverty reduction. </p>\n<p>Besides the frequency and timeliness of survey data, other data quality issues arise in measuring household living standards. The surveys ask detailed questions on sources of income and how it was spent, which must be carefully recorded by trained personnel. Income is generally more difficult to measure accurately, and consumption comes closer to the notion of living standards. And income can vary over time even if living standards do not. But consumption data are not always available: the latest estimates reported here use consumption data for about two-thirds of countries.</p>\n<p>However, even similar surveys may not be strictly comparable because of differences in timing or in the quality and training of enumerators. Comparisons of countries at different levels of development also pose a potential problem because of differences in the relative importance of the consumption of nonmarket goods. The local market value of all consumption in kind (including own production, particularly important in underdeveloped rural economies) should be included in total consumption expenditure but may not be. Most survey data now include valuations for consumption or income from own production, but valuation methods vary.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>To measure poverty across countries consistently, the World Bank&#x2019;s international measures apply a common standard, anchored to what &#x201C;poverty&#x201D; means in the world&#x2019;s poorest countries. The original &#x201C;$1-a-day&#x201D; line was based on a compilation of national lines for only 22 developing countries, mostly from academic studies in the 1980s (Ravallion, et al., 1991). While this was the best that could be done at the time, the sample was hardly representative of developing countries even in the 1980s. Since then, national poverty lines have been developed for many other countries. Based on a compilation of national lines for 75 developing countries, Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula (RCS) (2009) proposed a new international poverty line of $1.25 a day. This is the average poverty line for the poorest 15 countries in their data set. </p>\n<p>The current extreme poverty line is set at $3.00 a day in 2021 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the national poverty lines found in 23 low-income countries (Foster &#x24E1; al. 2025) . The new poverty line maintains the same standard for extreme poverty - the poverty line typical of the poorest countries in the world - but updates it using the latest information on the cost of living in developing countries. </p>\n<p>When measuring international poverty of a country, the international poverty line at PPP is converted to local currencies in 2021 prices and is then converted to the prices prevailing at the time of the relevant household survey using the best available Consumer Price Index (CPI). (Equivalently, the survey data on household consumption or income for the survey year are expressed in the prices of the ICP base year, and then converted to PPP $&#x2019;s.) Then the poverty rate is calculated from that survey. All inter-temporal comparisons are real, as assessed using the country-specific CPI. Interpolation/extrapolation methods are used to line up the survey-based estimates with these reference years.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>The raw data are obtained by poverty economists through their contacts in the NSOs, and checked for quality before being submitted for further analysis. The raw data can be unit-record survey data, or grouped data, depending on the agreements with the country governments. In most cases, the welfare aggregate, the essential element for poverty estimation, is generated by the country governments. Sometimes, the World Bank constructs the welfare aggregate or adjusts the aggregate provided by the country.</p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>\n<p>There is no &#x201C;imputation&#x201D; in the traditional sense for missing country data. However, to generate regional and global aggregates for reference years, country-level data are imputed for the years when surveys are not conducted. These imputed data are to be used for aggregation, but not for replacing the actual survey data. The subsequent section on the treatment of missing values at the regional and global levels provide more details on the imputation method.</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>\n<p>To compare the poverty rates across countries and compute regional aggregates, country estimates must be &#x201C;lined up&#x201D; first to a common reference year, interpolating for countries in which survey data are not available in the reference year but are available either before, after, or both. The more survey data are available (that is, the more data for different years), the more accurate the interpolation.</p>\n<p>The process requires adjusting the mean income or expenditure observed in the survey year by a growth factor to infer the unobserved level in the reference year. Thus, two assumptions are required to implement this process: distribution-neutral growth and a real rate of growth between the survey and reference year.</p>\n<p>Distribution-neutral growth implies that income or expenditure levels are adjusted for growth assuming that the underlying relative distribution of income or expenditure observed in survey years remains unchanged. Under this assumption, it is straightforward to interpolate the poverty estimate in a given reference year implied by a given rate of growth in income or expenditure. Rates of change in real consumption per capita should be based on the change in real consumption measured by comparing country survey data across different years. In practice, however, survey data in most countries are not available on an annual basis. Therefore, the change in private consumption per capita as measured from the national accounts is used instead. While, there can be no guarantee that the survey-based measure of income or consumption change at the same rate as private consumption in the national accounts, this appears to be the best available option.</p>\n<p>When the reference year falls between two survey years, an estimate of mean consumption at the reference year is constructed by extrapolating the means obtained from the surveys forward and backward to the reference year. The second step is to compute the headcount poverty rate at the reference year after normalizing the distributions observed in the two survey years by the reference year mean. This yields two estimates of the headcount poverty rates in the reference year. The final reported poverty headcount rate for the reference years is the linear interpolation of the two. When data from only one survey year are available, the reference year mean is based on the survey mean by applying the growth rate in private consumption per capita from the national accounts. The reference year poverty estimate is then based on this mean and on the distribution observed in the one survey year. The better data coverage is in terms of number and frequency of available surveys, the more accurate this lining-up process is and the more reliable the regional estimates will be.</p>\n<p>The aggregate headcount ratio for a region is the population-weighted mean of the headcount indices across the countries in that region. The number of poor in each region is the product of the region&#x2019;s headcount index and total regional population. This assumes that the poverty rate for a country without a household survey is the regional average.</p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>Because surveys are not conducted every year in most countries, poverty estimates have to be derived for line-up years by interpolation or extrapolation using national accounts data.
