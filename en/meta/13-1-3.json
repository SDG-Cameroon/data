The expected outcome of the Sendai Framework is to realize &#x201C;The substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries&#x201D;. Among the Sendai Framework global targets, &#x201C;Target E: Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020&#x201D; aims to enhance the global progress and coverage of national and local disaster risk reduction strategies and policies. The objectives of the national DRR plans, strategies and policies are to prevent new and reduce existing disaster risk through the implementation of integrated and inclusive economic, structural, legal, social, health, cultural, educational, environmental, technological, political and institutional measures that prevent and reduce hazard exposure and vulnerability to disaster, increase preparedness for response and recovery, and thus strengthen resilience. </p>\n<p>Increasing the proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies, which the Sendai Framework calls for, will contribute to sustainable development and strengthen economic, social, health and environmental resilience. Their economic, environmental and social perspectives would include poverty eradication, urban resilience, and climate change adaptation.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The Sendai Framework Monitoring (SFM) System has been developed to measure the progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework by UNGA endorsed indicators.
