The ASPIRE (Atlas of Social Protection &#x2013; Indicators of Resilience and Equity) team harmonizes social protection information captured by these household surveys to make the analysis reasonably comparable across countries and over time.</p>\n<p>The ASPIRE harmonization methodology for household survey data rests on the following three steps:</p>\n<p>1. <em>Identification and classification of social protection and labor (SPL) programs</em></p>\n<p>Household surveys are carefully reviewed to identify SPL program information. Once this information is identified, two levels of analysis are implemented: first, variables are created for each of the country specific programs found in the survey; second, program variables are aggregated and harmonized into 12 SPL program categories, and 2 private transfer categories. The country specific programs included into these SPL categories are documented in detail and validated with World Bank country task teams leaders in close coordination with national counterparts.</p>\n<p>ToTo generate the indicators, the following variables are also used: household identification number, location (urban/rural), household size, welfare aggregate (income or consumption), household weight, and two poverty lines: a relative poverty line, thatthat defines the poorest 20% of the welfare distribution, and the international poverty line of PPP $22.15 per day.</p>\n<p><em>2. Welfare aggregates</em></p>\n<p>Households are ranked in quintiles of percapita welfare (income or consumption). ASPIRE makes special efforts to include the most updated welfare aggregates officially agreed with NSOsNSOs and harmonized by the World Bank&#x2019;s Global Monitoring Database initiative, led by the Poverty and Equity Global Practice. These welfare aggregates are comparable across countries and across years for global poverty monitoring and welfare measurement. </p>\n<p>3. <em>PPP conversions</em></p>\n<p>All monetary variables (transfer amounts) and welfare aggregates are deflated to 2017 values and then expressed in 2017 purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. To this effect, the private consumption PPP conversion factor is used.</p>\n<p>Once the information is harmonized performance indicators are generated using ADePT social protection software developed by the World BankBank.</p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>Ongoing process </p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>Ongoing process</p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>World Bank</p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>World Bank</p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>The World Bank supports social protection and labor (SPL) systems in client countries as central part of its mission to reduce poverty through sustainable and inclusive growth.

Effective coverage is directly relevant to SDG 1 of ending poverty in all its forms. </p>\n<p>ASPIRE indicators do not include individuals who have benefits guaranteed but are not receiving them at the time when the survey is administered &#x2013; for example, people who actively contribute to old age pensions and are entitled to the benefits when reaching retirement age.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Information on country social protection and labor (SPL) programs included in ASPIRE (Atlas of Social Protection &#x2013; Indicators of Resilience and Equity) is limited to what is captured in the respective national representative household survey and does not necessarily represent the universe of programs existing in the country. In addition, the periodicity in which household surveys are produced by national statistical offices vary across countries, therefore, ASPIRE does not include balance panels for regional aggregates.</p>\n<p>Despite the above limitations, household surveys have the unique advantage of allowing analysis of program impact on household welfare.
