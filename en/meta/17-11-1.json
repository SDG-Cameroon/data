Goods are generally defined as physical, produced objects for which a demand exists, over which ownership rights can be established and whose ownership can be transferred from one institutional unit to another by engaging in transactions on markets.</p>\n<p>Services are understood as the result of a production activity that changes the conditions of the consuming units, or facilitates the exchange of products or financial assets, as defined in the <em>Manual on Statistics of International Trade in Services</em> <em>2010</em>, in accordance with the concepts of the balance of payments and of the national accounts. They can be differentiated into change-effecting services and margin services. Change-effecting services are outputs produced to order and typically result in changes in the condition of the consuming units, such as haircuts or education. Margin services are charges for the facilitation of change in ownership of goods, services, knowledge-capturing products, or financial assets. The production of services is generally simultaneous with their consumption.</p>\n<p>International trade in services takes place when a service is supplied in any of the following modes: 1) from one economy to another (services cross the border); 2) within an economy to a service consumer of another economy (consumer crosses the border); 3) by establishing affiliates in another economy (suppling company establishes a commercial presence abroad); 4) through the presence of natural persons of one economy in another economy (supplier crosses the border). </p>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>United States dollars</p>","CLASS_SYSTEM__GLOBAL":"<p>Countries and territories are defined based on the UNCTADstat classification of economies which is almost identical to the M49 Classification with a few exceptions or deviations marked with footnotes where needed.

Increasing export shares indicate a growing integration into world trade. This is considered as an important means for raising a country&apos;s economic output and welfare.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>While the aggregation of economies to groups of economies follows in general the M49 standard, slight deviations had to be made in cases where an M49 country is covered by the territory of the economy for which data have been collected. For example, the exports of the French overseas territories are included in the exports of France and the exports of the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are included in the exports of the United States of America. They are therefore not counted in the calculation of the developing countries&apos; export share. These cases are flagged in the dataset by a comment.</p>\n<p>By definition, international merchandise trade does not include: goods transported through a country; goods temporarily admitted or dispatched; goods for repair and maintenance; monetary gold, issued banknotes, securities and coins in circulation; goods consigned to and from the territorial enclaves; non-financial assets, ownership of which has been transferred from residents to non-residents without crossing borders; goods treated as part of trade in services, such as goods acquired by travellers, embassies and international organizations; goods under merchanting or operational lease; goods which got lost or destroyed on international transport; satellites moved to and launched from another country without change of ownership; goods functioning as means of transport; content delivered electronically; waste and scrap; goods entering or leaving the economic territory of a country illegally.</p>\n<p>Limitations of the trade-in-services statistics arise from difficulties to statistically capture certain service categories. Services are intangible products and activities, such as international property charges or audio-visual products. Services can be embedded in goods in varying degrees and not easily distinguishable from goods, like software. Furthermore, services provided by foreign affiliates within the economy in which the affiliates are established (services supplied by mode 3) are not covered by the balance-of-payments framework. They are therefore not measured by indicator 17.11.1. Intra-corporate services transactions represent another category difficult to seize.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Share of global trade is intended of a particular group of country fraction of total trade.</p>\n<p>While for merchandise trade data are consistent through he time series (2000-current), for services trade there might be difficulties related to lack of harmonization for data previous to 2005. Before 2005 data are reported according the 5th Balance of Payments Manual. After 2005, data have been converted according to the categories and principles established by the 6th edition of the Balance of Payments Manual.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Validation is performed for each series observing the reported values using outlier detection and validation with additional sources; and using aggregations (for regional aggregates) to ensure quality of the reported statistics. Data are collected primarily from national and international sources with integrated quality assurance and management processed, hence no further dedicated steps are taken in compilation of this indicator&#x2019;s statistics. </p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>Adjustments to the country classifications are marked with footnotes.

Alternatively mirror statistics can be used. Mirror statistics is the term used to define statistics that are calculated using partner country information when data for the analysed country are not available. For instance, the export of a country X could be recalculated using mirror statistics through the imports from country X of all its partners. It has to be kept in mind however imports are often reported CIF (i.e. including the cost of freight and insurance) while export FoB (i.e. free on board). The difference between these two reporting systems should be taken into account when using import data to estimate exports.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>At regional and global levels</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Answered above (in At country level section).</p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>Country exports at the 6 digit level of the Harmonized System (HS) classification are summed together at the regional level and then divided by the total amount of exports.</p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable</p>","QUALITY_MGMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>Provided above in section 4.d Validation.</p>","QUALITY_ASSURE__GLOBAL":"<p>Provided above in section 4.d Validation.</p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>Not applicable</p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p>Data availability:</p>\n<p>Asia and Pacific: 40</p>\n<p>Africa: 36</p>\n<p>Latin America and the Caribbean: 29</p>\n<p>Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan: 31</p>\n<p>Time series:</p>\n<p>Yearly data from 2000 to latest year </p>\n<p>Disaggregation:</p>\n<p>Disaggregation is available by product sector (e.g. Agriculture, Textile, Environmental goods), level of goods processing, geographical region and country income level (e.g. Developed, Developing, LDCs).</p>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>\n<p>Not applicable to this indicator.
