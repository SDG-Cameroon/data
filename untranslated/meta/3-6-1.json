This recording is based on the International Classification of Diseases (World Health Organization 1994), which covers road traffic deaths under Chapter XX: External Causes of Morbidity and Mortality, in a section on Transport Accidents (V01&#x2013;V99). According to ICD-10: &#x201C;Road traffic deaths are fatalities caused by injuries sustained in traffic accidents involving one or more moving vehicles on public highway&#x201D;. ICD-10 provides a detailed classification of road traffic injuries and deaths, with specific codes depending on the type of vehicle involved, the role of the injured person, and the circumstances of the accident. Common codes include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>V01&#x2013;V09: Pedestrians injured in transport accidents</li>\n  <li>V10&#x2013;V19: Cyclists injured in transport accidents</li>\n  <li>V20&#x2013;V29: Motorcycle riders injured in transport accidents</li>\n  <li>V30&#x2013;V39: Occupants of three-wheeled motor vehicles injured in transport accidents</li>\n  <li>V40&#x2013;V49: Car occupants injured in transport accidents</li>\n  <li>V50&#x2013;V59: Occupants of pick-up trucks or vans injured in transport accidents</li>\n  <li>V60&#x2013;V69: Occupants of heavy transport vehicles injured in transport accidents</li>\n  <li>V70&#x2013;V79: Bus occupants injured in transport accidents</li>\n  <li>V80&#x2013;V89: Other land transport accidents (e.g., animal-drawn vehicles, streetcars) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Death rate due to road traffic injuries as defined as the number of road traffic fatal injury deaths per 100,000 population. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Numerator: Number of deaths due to road traffic crashes </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Absolute figure indicating the number of people who die as result of a road traffic crash. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Denominator: Population (number of people by country) </p>","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"<p>Per 100,000 population </p>","CLASS_SYSTEM__GLOBAL":"<p>Road injuries are defined in terms of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) (See Annex A of the WHO methods and data sources for global causes of death, 2000&#x2013;2021) </p>\n<p>For countries where the ICD-10 has four characters, the codes to be filtered are as follows:</p>\n<p>V011:V019, V021:V029, V031:V039, V041:V049,V061:V069, V092 ,V093 ,V103:V109, V113:V119, V123:V129, V133:V139, V143:V149, V154:V159, V164:V169,V174:V179, V184:V189, V194:V199, V203:V209, V213:V219, V223:V229, V233:V239, V243:V249, V253:V259,V263:V269, V273:V279, V283:V289, V294:V299, V304:V309, V314:V319,V324:V329, V334:V339, V344:V349,V354:V359, V364:V369, V374:V379, V384:V389, V394:V399, V404:V409, V414:V419, V424:V429, V434:V439,V444:V449, V454:V459, V464:V469, V474:V479, V484:V489, V494:V499, V504:V509, V514:V519, V524:V529,V534:V539, V544:V549, V554:V559, V564:V569, V574:V579, V584:V589, V594:V599, V604:V609, V614:V619,V624:V629, V634:V639, V644:V649, V654:V659, V664:V669, V674:V679, V684:V689, V694:V699, V704:V709,V714:V719, V724:V729, V734:V739, V744:V749, V754:V759, V764:V769, V774:V779, V784:V789, V794:V799,V803:V805, V811, V821, V828, V829, V830:V833, V840:V843, V850:V853, V860:V863, V870:V879, V892, V893, V899, V99, Y850, X594;</p>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>For the road traffic deaths, we have two sources of data.

These crashes disproportionately affect young people, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In 2021, road traffic injuries became the leading cause of death for individuals aged 5 to 29 and the 14th leading cause of death across all age groups.
