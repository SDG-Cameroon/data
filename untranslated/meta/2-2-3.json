Part of WHO&apos;s mandate is to assess the micronutrient status of populations, monitor and evaluate the impact of strategies for the prevention and control of micronutrient malnutrition, and to track related trends over time.</p>\n<p>In 2012, the six global nutrition targets, contained within the Comprehensive Implementation Plan on Maternal, Infant, and Young Child Nutrition, were endorsed by Member States in resolution WHA 65.5. One of the targets is to reduce the prevalence of anemia in women of reproductive age by 50%. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting children and women of reproductive age. It negatively affects cognitive and motor development and work capacity, and among pregnant women iron deficiency anaemia is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, including preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia, but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex. Anaemia can be assessed by measuring blood haemoglobin, and when used in combination with other indicators of iron status, blood haemoglobin provides information about the severity of iron deficiency. The anaemia prevalence for the population is used to classify the public health significance of the problem.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Despite the extensive data search, data for blood haemoglobin concentrations are still limited, compared to other nutritional indicators such as child anthropometry ; this was especially true in the high-income countries of the WHO European Region. In addition, the current exercise enhanced the model by treating data differently by ensuring complete methodology for haemoglobin assessment was reported in all included data sources such as type of blood, and equipment&#x2019;s brand and model. As a result, the estimates may not capture the full variation across countries and regions, tending to &#x201C;shrink&#x201D; towards global means when data are sparse. </p>\n<p>Estimates may differ from those reported by countries. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age were obtained from 412 population-representative data sources from 122 countries worldwide. Data collected from the years 1995 to 2023 were used. Adjustment of data on blood haemoglobin concentrations for altitude and smoking was carried out whenever possible. Biologically implausible haemoglobin values (&lt;25 g/L or &gt;200 g/L) were excluded. A Bayesian hierarchical mixture model was used to estimate haemoglobin distributions and systematically addressed missing data, non-linear time trends, and representativeness of data sources. Based on the latest evidence, the use of venous blood was recommended as the gold standard for measuring haemoglobin concentrations due to its high accuracy. However, thus far, national survey data based on venous blood are limited compared to capillary blood. For the current exercise, we accounted for possible higher error in haemoglobin measurements using capillary blood by taking only the mean haemoglobin concentrations because means are not affected by higher measurement errors. We used all available summary statistics or individual-level data if assessment was done using venous blood. We also allowed for suspected biased measurements by measurement method when using HemoCue&#xAE; 301. These enhancements were applied considering the emerging evidence on measurement errors in haemoglobin that can influence the accuracy and precision of estimates.</p>\n<p>Full details on statistical methods may be found <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(22)00084-5/fulltext\">here</a>: National, regional, and global estimates of anaemia by severity in women and children for 2000&#x2013;19: a pooled analysis of population-representative data (Stevens et al, 2022). </p>\n<p>Briefly, the model calculates estimates for each country and year, informed by data from that country and year themselves, if available, and by data from other years in the same country and in other countries with data for similar time periods, especially countries in the same region. The model borrows data, to a greater extent, when data are non-existent or weakly informative, and to a lesser degree for data-rich countries and regions. The estimates are also informed by covariates that help predict haemoglobin levels, including socio-demographic index, meat supply (kcal/capita), and probit of overweight prevalence. The model included a variance term that accounted for unobserved design factors (sample design, season, haemoglobin measurement method, etc.) that lead to additional variability in the data beyond that expected due to sample size. Finally, the model accounted for the fact that subnational data and data that do not exactly cover the age ranges of interest may have larger variation than national data and data that exactly cover the age ranges of interest, respectively. We fitted the model to data from 1995 to 2023 to mitigate boundary effects but report results between 2000 and 2023, given data scarcity between 1995 and 1999.</p>\n<p>The uncertainty ranges (credibility intervals) reflect the major sources of uncertainty, including sampling error, non-sampling error due to issues in sample design/measurement, and uncertainty from making estimates for countries and years without data.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Once survey data are compiled and the Bayesian hierarchical mixture model is run to generate anaemia estimates, countries are sent a memorandum to provide a background to the estimates and explain the process. Information on the survey data used to generate the estimates for that country, estimates, and the resulting plots for each country are provided along with an explanation of the methodology used in generating the estimates. Countries are requested to provide feedback on the data sources used through a country consultation to inform the final estimates that will be shared with the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) for reporting. </p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>Data on mean haemoglobin and anaemia prevalence from high-altitude countries that were not adjusted for altitude when published were adjusted for altitude by WHO, as described in Stevens et al (2022).
