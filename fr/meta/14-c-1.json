It is a framework instrument, which provides for the development of other instruments that conform toits provisions. Therefore, progress in the implementation of international law as reflected in UNCLOS can only be comprehensively measured if progress in the implementation of ocean-related instruments that implement international law as reflected in UNCLOS, is also measured. </p>\n<p>Such instruments include, in particular, UNCLOS&#x2019;s two implementing agreements - the Agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (Part XI Agreement) and the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UNFSA). </p>\n<p>Accordingly, following extensive consultation with Member States and other stakeholders, the methodology for indicator 14.c.1 measures the number of countries making progress in ratifying, acceding to and implementing UNCLOS, the Part XI Agreement and UNFSA through legal, policy and institutional frameworks. </p>\n<p>Data collected through the first administration of the questionnaire, which is based on the indicator, will provide a baseline of the current state of ratification of, accession to and implementation of UNCLOS and its two implementing agreements.
