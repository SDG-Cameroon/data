Among the Sendai Framework global targets, &#x201C;Target E: Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020&#x201D; aims to enhance the global progress and coverage of national and local disaster risk reduction strategies and policies. The objectives of the national DRR plans, strategies and policies are to prevent new and reduce existing disaster risk through the implementation of integrated and inclusive economic, structural, legal, social, health, cultural, educational, environmental, technological, political and institutional measures that prevent and reduce hazard exposure and vulnerability to disaster, increase preparedness for response and recovery, and thus strengthen resilience. </p>\n<p>The indicator will build bridge between the SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR).
