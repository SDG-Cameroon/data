Therefore, FAO&#x2019;s work on the collection, collation, and harmonization of statistical information on food and diet represents a core element of the Organization&#x2019;s mandate. As stated in Article I of the Constitution of FAO, &#x201C;The Organization shall collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture.&#x201D; Hence, from its inception, FAO has strived to maintain the best possible capacity to collect, process, validate, harmonize, and analyse incoming data and generate accurate and timely information. Improving the quality, transparency, and access to FAO&#x2019;s statistical data is an important priority.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, FAO&#x2019;s Strategic Framework 2022-31 seeks to support the 2030 Agenda through the transformation to more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable agrifood systems for better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life, leaving no one behind. Under the pillar of &#x201C;better nutrition,&#x201D; FAO&#x2019;s mission is to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition in all its forms, including promoting nutritious food and increasing access to healthy diets. In-depth analyses of MDD-W have previously been included in flagship publications, such as <em>The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World </em>(6).</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Dietary diversity is a fundamental characteristic of healthy diets. No single food or food group provides the multitude of nutrients and other bioactive compounds necessary for optimal nutrition, growth, and long-term health. Eating a wide variety of foods therefore increases the likelihood that a diet will provide all the nutrients required by an individual. Diets that lack diversity increase the risk of micronutrient deficiencies, particularly for women who have relatively higher nutrient requirements, which can compromise health. Dietary diversity is therefore a long-standing public health principle widely advocated in food-based dietary guidelines (7), the World Health Organization&#x2019;s (WHO) <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet\">&#x2018;Healthy Diet&#x2019;</a> fact sheet, FAO and WHO&#x2019;s guiding principles for <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/ca6640en/ca6640en.pdf\">&#x2018;Sustainable healthy diets&#x2019;</a>, and UNICEF&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/media/113291/file/UNICEF%20Conceptual%20Framework.pdf\">&#x2018;Conceptual Framework on Maternal and Child Nutrition&#x2019;</a>.</p>\n<p>While quantitative dietary assessment methods provide the best measure of the healthfulness of diets, these are often labour-intense, costly and require significant capacity to carry out. As a result, they are not routinely carried out in most countries. The MDD-W questionnaire was developed in response to a need for a quick, low-cost method that captures some information of the healthfulness of diets. It also responded to the need for as an easy-to-understand indicator for advocacy and decision-making purposes, i.e. the percentage of women meeting a minimally acceptable dietary diversity.</p>\n<p>The basic interpretation of MDD-W is: &#x201C;X% of women achieved minimum dietary diversity,</p>\n<p>and they are more likely to have higher (more adequate) micronutrient intakes than the 100-X% of</p>\n<p>women who did not.&#x201D; MDD-W should not be interpreted as an indicator of overall diet quality, or ofindividual-level dietary diversity. There is no universal cut-off that denotes levels of severity or acceptability of MDD-W prevalence. Since 2016, FAO has provided guidance on how to collect, analyse, present, and interpret MDD-W data. The latest FAO guidance &#x2018;<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/cb3434en/cb3434en.pdf\">Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women: An updated guide to measurement - from collection to action</a>&#x2019; was published in 2021.</p>\n<p> </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>As household surveys are the primary source of data on MDD-W, the estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling and non-sampling error (e.g., potential omission or intrusion of food item examples on food lists, recall biases).</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The MDD-W indicator is calculated in two steps. The first step is to construct a food group diversity score summing the ten defined food groups.

The documents should allow for determination of household and individual response rate.</li>\n  <li>Plausible time trends: Country level data are reviewed for plausible time trends. In case of outliers FAO country offices are contacted to get additional information to explain available data/trends. </li>\n  <li>Adherence to standard questions and calculations: Survey questionnaires are reviewed to confirm adherence to global guidance in terms of methods and questions used to assess MDD-W.
