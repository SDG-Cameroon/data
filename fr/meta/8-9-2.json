The data available in ILOSTAT, and incorporated in the UN Tourism questionnaire, are provided by National Statistical Offices and, in some cases, Ministries of Labour or other related agencies operating at the country-level.</p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>UN Tourism and ILO.</p>","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>As per Article 13.3 of the agreement between the United Nations and the World Tourism Organization (UN Tourism), whereby UN Tourism became a specialized agency, &#x201C;the United Nations recognizes the World Tourism Organization as the appropriate organization to collect, to analyse, to publish, to standardize and to improve the statistics of tourism, and to promote the integration of these statistics within the sphere of the United Nations system&#x201D; (United Nations, 2003). The UN Tourism Department of Statistics, Standards and Data is charged with upholding this mandated and its work focuses on the development of international standards for measuring tourism, on capacity development, and on compiling and disseminating tourism statistics from all countries in the world.</p>\n<p>UN Tourism is the custodian agency for this SDG indicator 8.9.2.</p>\n<p>The data collection process is supported by the partnership between UN Tourism and the International Labour Organization (ILO), which is the UN focal point for labour statistics. ILO sets international standards for labour statistics through the International Conference of Labour Statisticians, and compiles and produces labour statistics, with the goal of disseminating internationally comparable datasets. It also provides technical assistance and training to ILO Member States, to support their efforts to produce high-quality labour market data.</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>This indicator on &#x201C;employed persons in the tourism industries&#x201D; covers a crucial aspect currently not monitored of SDG target 8.9 (&#x201C;by 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products&#x201D;). The proposed indicator directly addresses the target&#x2019;s aim of promoting tourism that creates jobs, and aligns well with overall intent of Goal 8 on economic growth and decent work.</p>\n<p>Also, &#x201C;Employed persons in the tourism industries&#x201D; addresses a critical policy issue that has become increasingly prominent since the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic increased the realization that tourism &#x2014;and especially its income (indicator 8.9.1) and employment (this indicator, 8.9.2) components &#x2014; sustains livelihoods, wellbeing and conservation efforts worldwide. It was acknowledged that tourism is be especially critical for sustainable development in remote, rural and natural places, and it offers employment opportunities for diverse groups of people. </p>\n<p>In addition, this indicator responds to requests made by the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) over the years. In 2017 the Statistical Commission &#x201C;<em>supported the development of the statistical framework for measuring sustainable tourism</em> [...] <em>which will include the development of indicators for sustainable tourism</em> [...]&#x201D; (United Nations Statistical Commission, 2017), and in 2022 it &#x201C;<em>requested the Group </em>[IAEG-SDGs]<em> to work in close coordination with the custodian agency</em> [UN Tourism] <em>on a proposal for indicators on sustainable tourism to better monitor target 8.9 </em>[&#x2026;]&#x201D; (United Nations Statistical Commission, 2017). Therefore, this indicator builds on the work of the IAEG-SDG Task Team on sustainable tourism, and draws on three decades of tourism statistics expertise.</p>\n<p>Finally, the indicator reflects extensive research and development through intergovernmental processes and in collaboration with ILO, to define an indicator that optimizes the criteria of: (i) agreed methodology and conceptual rigour (it is based on the UN-endorsed Statistical Framework for Measuring the Sustainability of Tourism), (ii) high policy relevance, responding to issues with respect to the related Target and Goal that are currently unmet in the indicator framework, and (iii) data availability in countries (with existing reporting mechanisms by ILO and UN Tourism), thus avoiding additional reporting burden for countries. Consequently, this indicator classifies as a Tier I indicator. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The following points aim to describe some limitations to be considered:</p>\n<p>The characteristics of the data source may impact international comparability, especially when the coverage of the country source is not complete (notably in terms of the tourism industries included and the level of ISIC disaggregation available), as some countries do not measure employment in all the ten internationally-comparable tourism industries. </p>\n<p>In the absence of labour force surveys, some countries may use an establishment survey to derive information for this indicator. However, such surveys usually have a minimum establishment size cut&#x2011;off point, and small units are not officially registered and are therefore not included. Consequently, employment data in the tourism industries may be underestimated.</p>\n<p>An important issue in tourism relates to the seasonality, stemming from variations in visitor flows over the year and therefore in the related demand for services and labour inputs (in particular, in the industries pertaining to accommodation for visitors and to food and beverage serving activities). Fluctuations over the year are smoothed over in yearly figures.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator is the sum of employed persons in the tourism industries listed in the section above: &#x201C;2.c.
